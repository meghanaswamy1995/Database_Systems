\cf0 This equation is the linear regression equation of the form y=mx+b . Where y is the dependent variable, x is the independent variable, m is the slope and b is the y-intercept of the line in a 2D plane.\
The above equation is used to estimate the MEDV values which acts as the dependent variable. Independent variables are CRIM, ZN, CHAS=1, NOX, RM, DIS, RAD, TAX, PTRATIO, B,  LSTAT. y-intercept of the line is 36.3411\
The number beside every independent variable is the coefficients or multipliers that describe the size of the effect the independent variables are having on dependent variable\'a0
\f1\i MEDV
\f0\i0 , and\'a036.341\'a0is the MEDV\'a0is predicted to have when all the independent variables are equal to zero. \
The prediction shows that the MEDV value is predicted to increase 0.0458 when ZN goes up by one, decrease by 0.1084 when CRIM goes up by one, likewise it is predicted to be 36.3411 when all variables are zero, similarly for others. \
This equation does not contain AGE and INDUS which means that they do not contribute to this relationship. Since CHAS value holds either  0 or 1, the CHAS value of only \'911\'92 (tract bounds river)is contributing to the relationship. \
